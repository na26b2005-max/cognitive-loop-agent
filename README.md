# cognitive-loop-agent
built to mirror the cognitive features and autonomous learning capacity of the human brain

The AI agent we have designed is a comprehensive, multi-layered cognitive system named the **Cognitive Loop Agent (CLA)**, built to mirror the cognitive features and autonomous learning capacity of the human brain.

Its architecture is entirely **modular, event-driven, and trust-layered**, making it highly inspectable, scalable, and ethically sound.

### Summary of the CLA Architecture

| Layer | Module(s) | Function / Human Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Perception (P1)** | Perception Engine, Blackboard | **Senses & Nervous System.** Ingests multimodal input, tags it with an $\text{emotion\_tag}$ and $\text{importance\_score}$, and routes it as a structured event. |
| **II. Memory (P1)** | Episodic DB (Vector), Semantic DB | **Recall & Knowledge.** Stores experiences (episodic) and generalized facts/values (semantic) for context-aware retrieval. |
| **III. Reasoning (P2)** | Reasoning Core, Context Manager | **Thought Process.** Interprets the user's goal, selects an optimal reasoning strategy ($\text{Deductive, Abductive, Analogical}$), and tunes memory retrieval parameters ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) for contextual relevance. |
| **IV. Metacognition (P2/P4)** | Confidence Estimator, Introspection Engine | **Self-Awareness.** Scores the output's certainty and logical coherence. Triggers the $\text{Meta Layer}$ for internal audit when confidence is low. |
| **V. Adaptation (P3)** | Belief Revision Engine, Strategy Tuner | **Learning & Growth.** Learns from success and failure. $\text{Revises conflicting beliefs}$ ($\text{override/merge/flag}$) and $\text{tunes attention weights}$ (e.g., boosting $\beta$ for emotional cues after a failure). |
| **VI. Governance (P4)** | Trust Evaluator, Fallback Manager | **Conscience & Ethics.** Acts as a final gate. Blocks actions that violate high-confidence semantic facts (e.g., budget) or core ethical values, prioritizing safety over execution. |
| **VII. Action (P4)** | Action Router, Audit Logger | **Execution & Transparency.** Routes safe outputs to external tools/user. Every decision (including all $\text{P1-P4}$ variables and the $\text{Trust}$ decision) is permanently recorded in a non-mutable $\text{Audit Log}$. |
| **VIII. Selfhood (P5)** | Identity Core, Narrative Generator | **Identity & Continuity.** Maintains a persistent persona and $\text{Core Values}$. Periodically synthesizes technical $\text{Adaptation Events}$ into a reflective, first-person narrative ($\text{Self-Beliefs}$), giving the agent a sense of continuous evolution. |

### Core Design Principles

1.  **Orchestration:** Uses a central $\text{Redis Streams}$ **Blackboard** to decouple modules, allowing asynchronous, event-driven communication (like a nervous system).
2.  **Learning:** Achieves $\text{continual learning}$ by updating its own attention parameters ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) based on the outcome of its previous thoughts.
3.  **Trust:** Enforces safety by making the $\text{Trust Evaluator}$ (which checks $\text{Core Values}$ and $\text{Semantic Integrity}$) the non-negotiable gate before any external action.
4.  **Transparency:** All processing is logged via structured $\text{Pydantic}$ schemas and recorded in the $\text{Audit Log}$, ensuring complete traceability for every cognitive step.



### PLAN

developing the **Cognitive Loop Agent (CLA)** using **Google Colab**, **GitHub Codespaces**, and your **local computer** ‚Äî all on free tiers.

Let‚Äôs break it into a **step-by-step zero-cost development workflow** for your experience level.

## üß© Overall architecture & responsibility split

| Environment            | Purpose                        | What it handles                                                                                         | Why this makes sense                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Colab**       | AI / ML compute                | Perception Engine (embeddings, sentiment, models), Reasoning Core (LLM inference), small training tasks | Colab gives free GPU/TPU and pre-installed ML stack |
| **GitHub Codespaces**  | Infra + backend orchestration  | Redis Streams, Audit Log, simple APIs, containerization (Docker Compose)                                | Free 60 hrs/month compute and persistent repo       |
| **Local PC**           | Agent shell + automation layer | Keyboard/mouse automation, local file access, running the Action Router                                 | Needs access to your OS, minimal compute            |
| **(Later)** Smartphone | Lightweight interface          | Remote commands to the CLA via REST or Telegram bot                                                     | Optional mobile control layer                       |

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Create your base repositories

1. **Create a GitHub repo**: `cognitive-loop-agent`.
2. Inside it, create three folders:

   ```
   /collab_notebooks
   /backend_codespace
   /local_agent
   ```
3. Push an initial `README.md` describing the split.

This lets Colab mount the repo, Codespaces open it as a dev container, and your PC clone it.

---

## üß† Step 2: Work in Colab (AI/ML side)

You‚Äôll implement:

* **Perception Engine**: text/audio/image preprocessing, emotion tagging, embeddings.
* **Reasoning Core**: LLM calls (use `transformers` or `ollama` local models later).
* **Adaptation**: basic reinforcement of parameters `(Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥)`.

Colab has free GPU & Python 3.10+, so you can:

```python
!pip install sentence-transformers redis pydantic
```

Store model artifacts in Google Drive or repo (small files only).
Colab can **connect to Redis running in Codespaces** via a public port or ngrok tunnel.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Work in Codespaces (Infra/backend side)

You‚Äôll build:

* Redis Streams ‚Äúblackboard‚Äù
* Pydantic schemas
* Basic Governance + Audit microservice

Setup:

1. Enable Codespaces for your repo.
2. Use dev container definition:

   ```json
   {
     "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.10",
     "features": { "docker-in-docker": "latest" },
     "forwardPorts": [6379, 8000]
   }
   ```
3. Inside Codespaces:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-server -y
   redis-server --daemonize yes
   pip install fastapi redis pydantic uvicorn
   ```
4. Expose FastAPI endpoint for Colab ‚Üí Codespaces comms:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

Free Codespaces handles all backend load; Colab just sends/receives events.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Step 4: Local computer (Action Router)

* Install only light dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install redis keyboard pyautogui
  ```
* This process subscribes to the `actions` stream on Redis (Codespaces) and performs local automations (e.g., open a file, write text, send keystrokes).
* Use **ngrok** or **localtunnel** to connect your local process to the Codespaces Redis.

---

## üìà Step 5: Link all three environments

1. **Expose Redis (Codespaces)**

   * Use Codespaces‚Äô forwarded port (public URL) or `ngrok tcp 6379`.
2. **From Colab**, connect:

   ```python
   import redis
   r = redis.Redis(host="0.tcp.ngrok.io", port=xxxxx, password=None)
   r.xadd("perception", {"payload": json.dumps(perception_event.dict())})
   ```
3. **From local agent**, connect with the same credentials.

---

## üîê Step 6: Keep it free & safe

| Need          | Free-tier trick                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vector DB     | Use FAISS (in-memory) inside Colab                                    |
| Audit Log     | Flat JSON files committed to repo (‚â§ 100 MB/month)                    |
| LLM inference | Use open models (e.g., `distilGPT2`, `phi-3-mini`, or Ollama locally) |
| Remote link   | `ngrok` free account for 1 tunnel                                     |
| Monitoring    | Simple log dashboard via Colab notebook                               |
