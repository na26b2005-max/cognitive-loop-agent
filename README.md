# cognitive-loop-agent
built to mirror the cognitive features and autonomous learning capacity of the human brain

The AI agent we have designed is a comprehensive, multi-layered cognitive system named the **Cognitive Loop Agent (CLA)**, built to mirror the cognitive features and autonomous learning capacity of the human brain.

Its architecture is entirely **modular, event-driven, and trust-layered**, making it highly inspectable, scalable, and ethically sound.

### Summary of the CLA Architecture

| Layer | Module(s) | Function / Human Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Perception (P1)** | Perception Engine, Blackboard | **Senses & Nervous System.** Ingests multimodal input, tags it with an $\text{emotion\_tag}$ and $\text{importance\_score}$, and routes it as a structured event. |
| **II. Memory (P1)** | Episodic DB (Vector), Semantic DB | **Recall & Knowledge.** Stores experiences (episodic) and generalized facts/values (semantic) for context-aware retrieval. |
| **III. Reasoning (P2)** | Reasoning Core, Context Manager | **Thought Process.** Interprets the user's goal, selects an optimal reasoning strategy ($\text{Deductive, Abductive, Analogical}$), and tunes memory retrieval parameters ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) for contextual relevance. |
| **IV. Metacognition (P2/P4)** | Confidence Estimator, Introspection Engine | **Self-Awareness.** Scores the output's certainty and logical coherence. Triggers the $\text{Meta Layer}$ for internal audit when confidence is low. |
| **V. Adaptation (P3)** | Belief Revision Engine, Strategy Tuner | **Learning & Growth.** Learns from success and failure. $\text{Revises conflicting beliefs}$ ($\text{override/merge/flag}$) and $\text{tunes attention weights}$ (e.g., boosting $\beta$ for emotional cues after a failure). |
| **VI. Governance (P4)** | Trust Evaluator, Fallback Manager | **Conscience & Ethics.** Acts as a final gate. Blocks actions that violate high-confidence semantic facts (e.g., budget) or core ethical values, prioritizing safety over execution. |
| **VII. Action (P4)** | Action Router, Audit Logger | **Execution & Transparency.** Routes safe outputs to external tools/user. Every decision (including all $\text{P1-P4}$ variables and the $\text{Trust}$ decision) is permanently recorded in a non-mutable $\text{Audit Log}$. |
| **VIII. Selfhood (P5)** | Identity Core, Narrative Generator | **Identity & Continuity.** Maintains a persistent persona and $\text{Core Values}$. Periodically synthesizes technical $\text{Adaptation Events}$ into a reflective, first-person narrative ($\text{Self-Beliefs}$), giving the agent a sense of continuous evolution. |

### Core Design Principles

1.  **Orchestration:** Uses a central $\text{Redis Streams}$ **Blackboard** to decouple modules, allowing asynchronous, event-driven communication (like a nervous system).
2.  **Learning:** Achieves $\text{continual learning}$ by updating its own attention parameters ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) based on the outcome of its previous thoughts.
3.  **Trust:** Enforces safety by making the $\text{Trust Evaluator}$ (which checks $\text{Core Values}$ and $\text{Semantic Integrity}$) the non-negotiable gate before any external action.
4.  **Transparency:** All processing is logged via structured $\text{Pydantic}$ schemas and recorded in the $\text{Audit Log}$, ensuring complete traceability for every cognitive step.
